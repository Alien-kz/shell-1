<br><img src="./images/shell.png" width="10%" alt = "image" align = "left"/> Welcome! Want to write your own shell, but don't know where to start? Use my open source shell and add your own ideas. Perhaps you can find simpler algorithms for what is already described in my program. I look forward to any of your comments!

### This shell can:
 * Standard launch of the program;
 * Redirect the input stream to a file;
 * Redirect input and output:
     - Redirect the output stream to a file;
     - Read from file;
     - Reading and writing to a file, writing and reading from a file in one run;
 * Run "&&" pipeline for multiple commands.
 * Run "|" pipeline for commands with redirection of input and output streams;
 * Change directory using `cd` command:
     - `cd` and `cd ~` to go to home directory;
     - `cd directory_name` to go to the specified directory (`cd ..` to go to the parent directory);
     - `cd -` to go to the previous directory;
 * Run programs in the background;
 *
